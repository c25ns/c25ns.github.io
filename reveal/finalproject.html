				<h1>My Year of Comp Sci and Projects</h1>
				<p class="fragment">HI! This was my year of comp sci and the theme that occured in each!</p>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="bluebox.jpg"> 
				<h1><a href="classprojectnat.html">Moving Square</a></h1>
				<p>And the theme is...BLUE!! This was one of my first projects in comp sci! I started off the year doing things in class with making divs and shapes. This projectis slightly simple but the reason I chose the color blue was because of my eyes :)</p>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="cora.jpg">
				<h1><a href="imageshover.html">Square Quilt</a></h1>
					<p>Moving forward in the year, we learned how to do other things such as event listeners. For this project I did something to do with hovering. This is one of my favorite projects from comp sci this year! I decided to put pictures of me and my friends when you hover over the individual boxes. I chose the color BLUE for the text to blend well with the color of the squares. I thought this was a nice way of representing my friendships :)</p>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="jeepblue.jpg">
				<h1><a href="carnat.html">Blue Jeep</a></h1>
				<p>Later in the year, we learned how to move pictures and divs accross the screen. This is another simple project with meaning. I chose to make the car a BLUE jeep because that is my dream car. Hopefully I can drive it when I'm older :)</p>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="vday.jpg">
				<h1><a href="valentinesday.html">VDAY CARD!</a></h1>
				<p>I used an event listener that said when you click, the card expands and displays the message. I chose to make a valentine's day card for my friends! I used BLUE for this card to make it stand out from other valentine's day cards! I used a cool javascript feature where the letter can expand when you click!</p>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="crinklecookie.jpg"> 
				<h1><a href="natslideshow.html">REVEAL JS SLIDESHOW</a></h1>
				<p>This is my favorite project of the year!! We used the reveal js code to make this which is very aesthetically pleasing and fun! I decided to do a slideshow on a cookie recipe because I love to bake with my mom! The blue theme comes in here at the end of my slideshow when I decided to serve my cookies on a blue plate!</p>
