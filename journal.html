	<h1>MY JOURNAL</h1>
	<h2>Welcome! Below, you will find my reflections from CS1!</h2>

	<p>9/30/22 - In comp sci so far, I have learned how to make a person card and about the basics of coding. Additionally, as a class we have learned about "metta" and what that means! Computer Science is a very interesting course and I am excited to work more on my website this year!

<p>10/06/22 - In comp sci this past week, I have made my menu bar and changed the font of my text on the index page. I additionally have made a button which reacts to a hover (change a color over the text) I am planning on putting these changes on the web next class!
