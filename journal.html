	<h1>MY JOURNAL</h1>
	<h2>Welcome! Below, you will find my reflections from CS1!</h2>

	<p>9/30/22 - In comp sci so far, I have learned how to make a person card and about the basics of coding. Additionally, as a class we have learned about "metta" and what that means! Computer Science is a very interesting course and I am excited to work more on my website this year!

<p>10/06/22 - In comp sci this past week, I have made my menu bar and changed the font of my text on the index page. I additionally have made a button which reacts to a hover (change a color over the text) I am planning on putting these changes on the web next class!

	10/27/22 - In comp sci currently, I am working on my animation and figuring out how to make my website very aesthetically pleasing. I am a little confused about how to make the animation but hopefully I'll figure it out with molly! I'm excited to make my animation!!

	11/07/22 - In comp sci today, we learned about event listeners. Event listeners are a way that you can program the code to react to the action of clicking. I.e. reacting to the press of a key or something like that. You have to make a "." to get into the console.log

	12/12/22 - It's been a while since I've written here! In comp sci, we have learned about array's and different functions. I am currently working on coding my claw machine and additionally I am making a code that has an array. I'm excited to see the final projects! I just met with molly and she helped me code a div that follows my mouse when I click. I learned how event listeners and divs are connected through coding this.

<p> 2/03/23 - Today in comp sci, we delved into the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence (AI). We learned about machine learning algorithms and how they can be trained to recognize patterns and make predictions. It's incredible to see how AI is revolutionizing various industries and shaping the future of technology! xoxo, natðŸ’“ </p> 

<p> 3/11/23 - In comp sci class this week, we focused on for-loops in programming. We explored how for-loops can automate repetitive tasks by iterating over a collection of items. I practiced writing for-loops in JavaScript to process arrays and perform specific actions. It's a powerful tool that saves a lot of time and effort! xoxo, natðŸ’“ </p> 

<p> 4/02/23 - Today, we had a fun session in comp sci where we learned about animation in web development. We explored CSS transitions and keyframes to create dynamic and visually appealing effects on our web pages. I experimented with different animations, from simple fade-ins to complex transformations. It's incredible how animation can enhance user experience! xoxo, natðŸ’“ </p> 

<p> 4/18/23 - In comp sci today, we dived deeper into JavaScript and its vast capabilities. We explored advanced concepts such as closures, higher-order functions, and asynchronous programming. I worked on a project that utilized JavaScript's event-driven nature to create interactive and dynamic web applications. JavaScript truly is the backbone of modern web development! xoxo, natðŸ’“ </p>

<p> 4/25/23 - This week, we focused on styling tags in HTML and CSS. We learned how to use different tags, such as h1, p, div, and apply custom styles to them. I played around with colors, fonts, and layouts to create visually appealing web pages. It's amazing how a few well-applied styles can transform the look and feel of a website! xoxo, natðŸ’“ </p>

 <p> 5/02/23 - Today, we explored the power of reveal.js in creating stunning presentations. We learned how to structure our slides, add content, and apply eye-catching transitions. I created a captivating presentation that showcased my coding projects from the semester. reveal.js is a game-changer when it comes to presenting information in a visually engaging manner! xoxo, natðŸ’“

 <p>As I sit here, reflecting on the past year in my computer science class, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions. It has been an incredible journey filled with learning, growth, and moments of both excitement and confusion. Looking back, I can see how far I've come and how much I've learned in this field that once seemed so foreign to me. Allow me to recap the highlights of this amazing year. At the beginning of the year, I embarked on this computer science adventure with enthusiasm and curiosity. I learned how to create a person card and gained a basic understanding of coding. The concept of "metta" resonated with me, emphasizing the importance of kindness and empathy in all aspects of life, including the realm of technology. As the weeks progressed, I delved deeper into web development, making significant strides in enhancing my website. I conquered challenges, such as creating a menu bar, changing font styles, and incorporating hover effects. These small victories fueled my motivation and confidence, propelling me to push further. One of the most exciting moments came when I tackled animation. I dedicated myself to making my website aesthetically pleasing and captivating. I must admit, I struggled at first, but with the guidance of my mentor, Molly, I was able to bring my ideas to life. The connection between event listeners and divs became clear to me, and I reveled in the joy of creating beautiful animations. In the subsequent months, I explored various concepts and tools within computer science. I learned about event listeners and their ability to make code react to user actions, expanding my repertoire of interactive possibilities. The introduction to arrays and different functions opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me. I even coded my own claw machine, a project that challenged and rewarded me in equal measure. As the year progressed, my skills continued to grow. I successfully linked my projects on my website and prepared to launch it onto the internet. The desire to create more advanced and professional projects ignited within me, propelling me towards excellence. Our foray into the realm of artificial intelligence left me in awe of the power of machine learning algorithms. Witnessing how AI is revolutionizing industries and shaping our technological future was both fascinating and inspiring. It solidified my belief that computer science is an ever-evolving field with limitless potential. From for-loops to CSS transitions, I embraced each topic with enthusiasm. I realized the power of automation through for-loops and how it can save time and effort. The world of animation in web development fascinated me, and I played with different effects to enhance the user experience. Furthermore, I delved into advanced JavaScript concepts like closures and higher-order functions, gaining a deeper understanding of the language that drives modern web development. Styling tags in HTML and CSS allowed me to explore the creative side of web design. It amazed me how a few well-applied styles could transform the look and feel of a website. Additionally, reveal.js proved to be an invaluable tool for creating stunning presentations that showcased my coding projects in an engaging and visually appealing manner. And now, as I write this final journal entry, a sense of bittersweetness washes over me. The year has come to a close, and I must bid farewell to this incredible computer science class. I am immensely grateful for the knowledge I have gained, the friendships I have formed, and the journey I have taken. Computer science has given me a new perspective on problem-solving, creativity, and the power of technology to shape our world. It has sparked a passion within me to continue exploring and growing in this field, to never stop learning, and to make a positive impact through the applications I create. Thank you, computer science, for an unforgettable year. With so much love, XOXO, natðŸ’“</p>
