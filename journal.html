	<h1>MY JOURNAL</h1>
	<h2>Welcome! Below, you will find my reflections from CS1!</h2>

	<p>9/30/22 - In comp sci so far, I have learned how to make a person card and about the basics of coding. Additionally, as a class we have learned about "metta" and what that means! Computer Science is a very interesting course and I am excited to work more on my website this year!

<p>10/06/22 - In comp sci this past week, I have made my menu bar and changed the font of my text on the index page. I additionally have made a button which reacts to a hover (change a color over the text) I am planning on putting these changes on the web next class!

	10/27/22 - In comp sci currently, I am working on my animation and figuring out how to make my website very aesthetically pleasing. I am a little confused about how to make the animation but hopefully I'll figure it out with molly! I'm excited to make my animation!!

	11/07/22 - In comp sci today, we learned about event listeners. Event listeners are a way that you can program the code to react to the action of clicking. I.e. reacting to the press of a key or something like that. You have to make a "." to get into the console.log

	12/12/22 - It's been a while since I've written here! In comp sci, we have learned about array's and different functions. I am currently working on coding my claw machine and additionally I am making a code that has an array. I'm excited to see the final projects! I just met with molly and she helped me code a div that follows my mouse when I click. I learned how event listeners and divs are connected through coding this.

	1/09/22 - Today in comp sci molly helped me link my projects on my projects page. We are also going to push my website on the internet. I want to make a project next that is more advanced and looks more professional.
