	<h1>MY JOURNAL</h1>
	<h2>Welcome! Below, you will find my reflections from CS1!</h2>

	<p>9/30/22 - In comp sci so far, I have learned how to make a person card and about the basics of coding. Additionally, as a class we have learned about "metta" and what that means! Computer Science is a very interesting course and I am excited to work more on my website this year!

<p>10/06/22 - In comp sci this past week, I have made my menu bar and changed the font of my text on the index page. I additionally have made a button which reacts to a hover (change a color over the text) I am planning on putting these changes on the web next class!

	10/27/22 - In comp sci currently, I am working on my animation and figuring out how to make my website very aesthetically pleasing. I am a little confused about how to make the animation but hopefully I'll figure it out with molly! I'm excited to make my animation!!

	11/07/22 - In comp sci today, we learned about event listeners. Event listeners are a way that you can program the code to react to the action of clicking. I.e. reacting to the press of a key or something like that. You have to make a "." to get into the console.log

	12/12/22 - It's been a while since I've written here! In comp sci, we have learned about array's and different functions. I am currently working on coding my claw machine and additionally I am making a code that has an array. I'm excited to see the final projects! I just met with molly and she helped me code a div that follows my mouse when I click. I learned how event listeners and divs are connected through coding this.

	1/09/23 - Today in comp sci molly helped me link my projects on my projects page. We are also going to push my website on the internet. I want to make a project next that is more advanced and looks more professional.

<p> 2/03/23 - Today in comp sci, we delved into the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence (AI). We learned about machine learning algorithms and how they can be trained to recognize patterns and make predictions. It's incredible to see how AI is revolutionizing various industries and shaping the future of technology! xoxo, natðŸ’“ </p> 

<p> 3/11/23 - In comp sci class this week, we focused on for-loops in programming. We explored how for-loops can automate repetitive tasks by iterating over a collection of items. I practiced writing for-loops in JavaScript to process arrays and perform specific actions. It's a powerful tool that saves a lot of time and effort! xoxo, natðŸ’“ </p> 

<p> 4/02/23 - Today, we had a fun session in comp sci where we learned about animation in web development. We explored CSS transitions and keyframes to create dynamic and visually appealing effects on our web pages. I experimented with different animations, from simple fade-ins to complex transformations. It's incredible how animation can enhance user experience! xoxo, natðŸ’“ </p> 

<p> 4/18/23 - In comp sci today, we dived deeper into JavaScript and its vast capabilities. We explored advanced concepts such as closures, higher-order functions, and asynchronous programming. I worked on a project that utilized JavaScript's event-driven nature to create interactive and dynamic web applications. JavaScript truly is the backbone of modern web development! xoxo, natðŸ’“ </p>

<p> 4/25/23 - This week, we focused on styling tags in HTML and CSS. We learned how to use different tags, such as h1, p, div, and apply custom styles to them. I played around with colors, fonts, and layouts to create visually appealing web pages. It's amazing how a few well-applied styles can transform the look and feel of a website! xoxo, natðŸ’“ </p>

 <p> 5/02/23 - Today, we explored the power of reveal.js in creating stunning presentations. We learned how to structure our slides, add content, and apply eye-catching transitions. I created a captivating presentation that showcased my coding projects from the semester. reveal.js is a game-changer when it comes to presenting information in a visually engaging manner! xoxo, natðŸ’“

 <p>Im sad to see comp sci come to a close! It was an amazing year</p>
